# 6. Shipments

We'll start the shipment section with the different shipment option combinations
available in MyParcel. It is highly recommended that you read this first as this
section helps you understand what all the shipment options are and which
combinations are possible. We will not list every possible combination since
there are too many to list. We will look at the different package types and then
look at the different options available to them. Then we bring all of it
together with some examples.

## 6.A Shipment option combinations

### 6.A.1 Package types

There are four different packages types available and determine the name of
shipment. The value is sent with
the <ApiLink to="7_C">ShipmentOptions</ApiLink>
.package_type
field.

#### 1. Package

This is the standard package type used for NL, EU and Global shipments. It
supports a variety of additional options such as insurance, xl format etc. We
will look at these options in more detail later. This package is most commonly
used when creating shipments.

#### 2. Mailbox package

This package type is only available on <DataType type="platform" id="1" />
and <DataType type="platform" id="3" /> for NL shipments that fit into a
mailbox. It does not support additional options.

::: note
If you still make the request with additional options, bear in mind that you may
pay more than is necessary!
:::

#### 3. Letter

This package type is available on <DataType type="platform" id="1" /> for NL, EU
and Global shipments. The label for this shipment is unpaid meaning that you
will need to pay the postal office/courier to send this letter/package.
Therefore, it does not support additional options.

#### 4. Digital stamp

This package type is only available on <DataType type="platform" id="1" /> for
NL shipments and does not support any additional options. Its price is
calculated using the
package <ApiLink to="7_N">weight</ApiLink> .

**Note: This shipment will appear on your invoice
on <DataType type="shipment-status" id="2" /> as opposed to all other package
types, which won't appear on your invoice until
shipment <DataType type="shipment-status" id="3" />.**

### 6.A.2 Delivery types

There are five different delivery types and these specify how the package is
delivered. The value is sent with the ShipmentOptions.delivery_type field.
Currently, delivery types are only available for NL and BE shipments
with <DataType type="package-type" id="1" />. Delivery types 1-5 for NL and 1,4
for BE. The address of the package determines the delivery types available. You
need to use the DeliveryOptions interface to fetch the delivery types for a
specific address. It is also possible to specify a date on which the package has
to be delivered with the ShipmentOptions.delivery_date field. With delivery
types 1 & 3 ShipmentOptions.delivery_date is required.

#### 1. Morning

This option is only available for certain NL addresses. It allows a
Customer/Consumer to have their package delivered early in the morning on the
delivery date specified except on Saturday and Sunday.

#### 2. Standard

This is the standard delivery type.

#### 3. Evening

This option is only available on <DataType type="platform" id="1" />
and <DataType type="platform" id="3" /> for certain NL addresses. It allows a
Customer/Consumer to have their package delivered in the evening on the
specified delivery date.

#### 4. Pickup

The package is delivered at the chosen drop-off point specified by the
Consumer/Customer.

#### 5. Pickup express

The same as pickup but the package is available for pickup before 8:30AM on the
delivery date specified at the drop-off location. Only available on MyParcel.nl
and Flespakket.

### 6.A.3 Options

These are the different package options such as insurance, recipient only,
signature on receipt, XL format etc. These options are specified in
the <ApiLink to="7_C">ShipmentOptions</ApiLink>
object. These options are only available
for <DataType type="package-type" id="1" />.

#### only_recipient

Deliver the package only at address of the intended recipient. This option is
required for Morning and Evening delivery types.

#### signature

Recipient must sign for the package. This option is required for Pickup and
Pickup express delivery types.

#### return

Return the package to the sender when the recipient is not home.

#### large_format

This option must be specified if the dimensions of the package are between 100 x
70 x 50 and 175 x 78 x 58 cm. If the scanned dimensions from the carrier
indicate that this package is large format, and it has not been specified then
it will be added to the shipment in the billing process. This option is also
available for EU shipments.

#### insurance

This option allows a shipment to be insured up to certain amount.
Only <DataType type="package-type" id="1" /> shipments can be insured. NL
shipments can be insured for 500,- euros. EU shipments **must** be insured for
500,- euros. Global shipments **must** be insured for 200,- euros. The following
shipment options are **mandatory** when insuring an NL shipment: only_recipient
and signature.

#### age_check

Only available on <DataType type="platform" id="1" />
and <DataType type="platform" id="3" />. The Customer/Consumer must sign for the
package and only receive it when he is at least 18 years.

### 6.A.4 Examples

::: expand h4 Pickup

We want to send a package to a consumer in Utrecht. He will pick the package up
at the nearest pickup location. The shipment looks like this.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "shipments": [
      {
        "options": {
          "package_type": 1,
          "only_recipient": 0,
          "signature": 1,
          "delivery_type": 4
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Let's go through this example. This package will be picked up by the customer,
so it needs to <DataType type="package-type" id="1" />
with <DataType type="delivery-type" id="4" />. All
pickup packages need to have signature set. A pickup location needs to be
specified as well.
:::

::: expand h4 Evening

We want to send a package to a consumer in Utrecht that has to be delivered on
Tuesday evening. The shipment looks like this.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "shipments": [
      {
        "options": {
          "package_type": 1,
          "delivery_type": 3,
          "only_recipient": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Let's go through this example. This package will be delivered to the consumer in
the evening, so it needs <DataType type="package-type" id="1" />
with <DataType type="delivery-type" id="3" />. All evening and morning packages
need to have only_recipient set.
:::

::: expand h4 NL insured

We want to send a Rolex to a customer in Maastricht. This shipment needs to be
insured up to € 5000,–. The shipment looks like this.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "shipments": [
      {
        "options": {
          "package_type": 1,
          "insurance": {
            "amount": 500000,
            "currency": "EUR"
          },
          "signature": 1,
          "only_recipient": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Only <DataType type="package-type" id="1" /> can be insured so [package type] is
set to 1. Insurance amount needs to be specified in cents and needs to be one of
these amounts (10000, 25000, 50000, 500000, <= 500000). The package needs to be
insured up to 5000 euros, so we set `insurance.amount` to 500000 cents. All NL
insured packages need to have signature and only_recipient set, so we set them
as well.

:::

::: expand h4 EU and Global insured

We want to send an expensive Japanese vase to a Belgian friend of ours in
Brussels. This package is large format because it's dimensions are within 100 x
70 x 50 and 175 x 78 x 58 cm range. Since this is an EU shipment is must be
insured up to 500 euros.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "shipments": [
      {
        "options": {
          "package_type": 1,
          "insurance": {
            "amount": 50000,
            "currency": "EUR"
          },
          "large_format": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This package is an EU package so the name must be set to 1. All EU and Global
shipments **must** be insured up to 500 (EU) / 200 (Global) euros, so we set the
insured amount to 50000 **cents.** EU and Global shipments do not have the
only_recipient, signature and return options so these cannot be set for this
shipment.

## 6.B Add Shipment

### 6.B.1 Overview

Add shipments allows you to create standard and related return shipments. The
data format can be JSON or CSV. Only standard national and EU shipments can be
created with CSV. There are two ways of sending CSV: raw CSV or CSV file as part
of multipart/form-data. You can specify the column mapping for CSV by including
it as the first line in the CSV file or as a separate field named '
column_mapping' in the multipart/form-data.

For JSON requests
a <ApiLink to="7_G">ShipmentIds</ApiLink>
object is returned. The ids in
the <ApiLink to="7_G">ShipmentIds</ApiLink>
object will be in the same order they were sent.

For CSV requests <Http code=204 /> with empty response body is returned. If a
request fails then an <Http code="4xx" /> is returned.

### 6.B.3 Request Headers

**Content-Type: application/vnd.shipment+json;version=1.1**  
Specify this Content-Type when you want to create standard shipments.

**Content-Type: application/vnd.return_shipment+json;version=1.1**  
Specify this Content-Type when you want to create related return shipments.  
Parent shipment cannot be a concept (<DataType type="shipment-status" id="1" />)
.  
When a label is generated, the status of the shipment is converted to
registered ( [shipment_status] 2).

**Content-Type: application/vnd.unrelated_return_shipment+json;version=1.1**  
Specify this Content-Type when you want to create unrelated return shipments.

### 6.B.4 Examples

In these examples we are going to create shipments.

::: expand h4: Create domestic PostNL shipments

The following example creates a PostNL shipment to a Dutch recipient address.
Domestic PostNL shipments are also supported on sendmyparcel.be, using a Belgian
address instead.

## 6.C Delete Shipment

::: note
Deleting shipments is not done often. This can only be done for shipments for
which a label has not yet been
created (<DataType type="shipment-status" id="1" />). Especially since shipments
not handed over to the distributor will not be billed by MyParcel. Therefore,
when unused shipments are not deleted this has no financial consequences.
:::

### 6.C.1 Overview

Use this link to remove shipments. You can specify multiple shipment ids by
semicolon separating them on the URL. Only shipments
with <DataType type="shipment-status" id="1" /> can be deleted. This method
returns <Http code=204 /> if successful.
If the shipment doesn't exist a <Http code="422" /> is returned.

## 6.F Get Shipment label

### 6.F.1 Overview

Get shipment label. You can specify label format and starting position of labels
on the first page with the **format** and **position** query parameters. The **
position** query only works when you specify the A4 format and is only applied
on the first page with labels.Accounts with **Post-payment** payment methods can
fetch multiple labels in one call. For accounts with **Pre-payment** payment
method an `<Http code=402 /> Payment Required` with a <ApiLink to="7_P">
PaymentInstructions</ApiLink> object is returned if the label has not been paid
for yet.

When a label for a multi collo shipment is requested, labels for all shipments
part of the multi collo shipment will be generated. Each shipment within a multi
collo shipment MUST be labeled with a specific label containing a unique
barcode.

Upon error <Http code="4xx" /> with a response body containing an Error is
returned.

If you want to retrieve more than 25 labels in one response, you can use 
`Accept: application/vnd.shipment_label_link+json;charset=utf8`. You will
receive a URL to a label, but the label is not immediately available and will
return an <Http code=404 /> until it is ready. Depending on the number of

### 6.H.1 Overview

This section describes the working of multi collo shipments. The multi collo
shipment is a special name of shipment which requires a specific way of
handling. A multi collo shipment is a shipment which contains multiple packages
for the same address and the same delivery date. It contains of one 'main'
shipment and at least one 'secondary' shipment. Working with multi collo
shipments does not require using specific endpoints but existing endpoints have
specific behaviour in combination with multi collo shipments.

### 6.H.2 Create

This section extends the <ApiLink to="6_B">base functionality</ApiLink>.

Creating a multi collo shipment basically means using one extra
property `secondary_shipments`. This property can be used to pass an array of
json objects. Each object represents an extra shipment to be part of the multi
collo shipment. All required properties of the main shipment are inherited by
the secondary shipments so there is no need to pass data with a secondary
shipment, but it is allowed to pass specific data. This might be useful for
example to pass a specific reference identifier per secondary shipment. Shipment
options MUST be provided only with the main shipment. Secondary shipments only
can be used in combination with <DataType type="package-type" id="1" /> and can
only be used for shipments to NL en BE.

```json
{
  "secondary_shipments": [
    {
      "reference_identifier": "SECONDARY-SHIPMENT"
    }
  ]
}
```

Updating a secondary shipment can be done in several ways using different
endpoints.

#### Add secondary shipment

Adding an existing shipment to an existing multi collo shipment can be done in
two ways.

1. Post complete shipment with an extra shipment passed in
   the `secondary_shipments` property.  
```json
{
  "secondary_shipments": [
    {
      "id": 12345
    },
    {
      "id": 34567
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Update a single existing shipment with a reference to a multi collo shipment
   via the `multi_collo_main_shipment_id`.
```json
{
  "multi_collo_main_shipment_id": 34567
}
```

Adding a non-existent shipment to an existing multi collo shipment can be done
via the `secondary_shipments` property of the main shipment.  

```json
{
  "secondary_shipments": [
    {
      "id": 12345
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the existing secondary shipments should always be passed as well
because they will be deleted otherwise.

#### Remove secondary shipment

Removing a secondary shipment from a multi collo shipment can be done in 3
different ways.

1. Delete secondary shipment. Make use of
the <ApiLink to="6_C">delete endpoint</ApiLink> when
   passing the id of the secondary shipment. This will cause the secondary
   shipment to be deleted and removed from the multi collo shipment.

2. Omit the secondary shipment in
   an <ApiLink to="6_H_3">update</ApiLink> request on the multi collo
   main shipment. This will cause the secondary shipment to be deleted and be
   removed from the multi collo shipment.

3. Unlink a secondary shipment from the multi collo shipment. This is done by a
   PUT request for a specific secondary shipment with an empty reference to the
   multi collo main shipment. This will cause the shipment to be removed from
   the multi collo shipment and still be available as normal shipment. The data
   passed in the PUT request for secondary shipment 1234 to remove it from its
   multi collo shipment should contain besides all other required data:

```json
{
  "id": 1234,
  "multi_collo_main_shipment_id": null
}
```

### 6.H.4 Delete

This section extends the <ApiLink to="6_C">base functionality</ApiLink>.
Deleting a multi collo main shipment will result in a complete removal of the
main and secondary shipments of the multi collo shipment.

Deleting a secondary shipment will result in deleting the shipment and removal
of the secondary shipment from the multi collo shipment.
