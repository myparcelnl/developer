# 1. Requests

## 1.A Base URL

BaseURL: **https://api.myparcel.nl**

## 1.B User-Agent

To give us insight into where requests come from and API documentation usage, you should send a `User-Agent` header with all your requests. This header should include information about your integration, the CMS/platform and the backend you are using.

We recommend the following format and order:

```
MyParcel-<integration>/<version> <cms>/<version> <backend>/<version>
```

Example, given you're using a CMS called "My First CMS", its version is `3.0.0` and it runs on PHP `8.1.0`:

```
User-Agent: MyFirstCMS/3.0.0 PHP/8.1.0
```

An example if you're building a MyParcel plug-in for "My First CMS" and its version is `1.0.0`:

```
User-Agent: MyParcel-MyFirstCMS/1.0.0 MyFirstCMS/3.0.0 PHP/8.1.0
```

::: tip
If you are building an integration, please contact us to have it added to [the list of integrations](/integrations).
:::

Example if you are building a custom API implementation and are running Node 18.13.0:

```
User-Agent: CustomApiCall/2 Node/18.13.0
```

## 1.C HTTP methods

The API is REST(ful) and uses JSON as its primary data exchange format.
Communication with the API goes through HTTPS thereby insuring data
confidentiality and integrity. Here is a list of all supported HTTP methods

### 1.C.1 GET

GET method is used for retrieving data and is idempotent. Data can be returned
in JSON, PDF, CSV, XML or other formats.

### 1.C.2 POST

POST is used to create new objects or send data to MyParcel.

### 1.C.3 DELETE

DELETE is used to delete an existing object (piece of data). This method always
returns <Http code=204 /> unless otherwise specified.

### 1.C.4 PUT

A PUT request creates a resource or updates an existing resource. The client for
specifies the URI for the resource. The request body contains a complete
representation of the resource. If a resource with this URI already exists, it
is replaced. Otherwise, a new resource is created, if the server supports doing
so.

### 1.C.5 PATCH

A PATCH request performs a partial update to an existing resource.
The client specifies the URI for the resource. The request body specifies a set
of changes to apply to the resource. This can be more efficient than using

## 1.D Rate limiting

Default rate limits apply to many of our documented endpoints.
Customers who would like a higher rate limit can contact us to discuss the possibilities
(e.g. increasing the limit, or using a webhook).
When the limit is reached for a Method/Endpoint combination, any additional call will return 
an HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests), effectively ignoring the request.
A sliding window is used to determine the rate limit.
Calls resulting in an HTTP 429 also count as requests, so it is better to wait a while before retrying than continually
retrying and getting additional HTTP 429 responses.
Waiting 5 minutes will definitely reset the rate limit for the used Method/Endpoint combination.

Example: If you make 100 GET requests within 15 seconds to the same endpoint with an
allowed rate limit of 100 request per 5 minutes, you will only be able to continue sending GETs 4 minutes 45
seconds later. Sending some POSTs to the same endpoint is allowed though, it follows its own rate limit.
