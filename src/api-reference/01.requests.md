# 1. Requests

## 1.A Base URL

BaseURL: **https://api.myparcel.nl**

## 1.B User-Agent

To give us insight that you use the API documentation, you should always send a
User-Agent in your header. If you do not use a known CMS, use the following
header:  
`User-Agent: CustomApiCall/2`

If you are using a known CMS then you should use the name of the CMS followed by
its version number (`User-Agent: <product> / <product-version>`). Here's an
example if your CMS is WordPress: `User-Agent: Wordpress/4.8.1`.

## 1.C HTTP methods

The API is REST(ful) and uses JSON as its primary data exchange format.
Communication with the API goes through HTTPS thereby insuring data
confidentiality and integrity. Here is a list of all supported HTTP methods

### 1.C.1 GET

GET method is used for retrieving data and is idempotent. Data can be returned
in JSON, PDF, CSV, XML or other formats.

### 1.C.2 POST

POST is used to create new objects or send data to MyParcel.

### 1.C.3 DELETE

DELETE is used to delete an existing object (piece of data). This method always
returns <Http code=204 /> unless otherwise specified.

## 1.D Rate limiting

Rate limits apply to many of our endpoints. You cannot receive data after you
have exceeded the limit. The rate limiting will be reached when you make more
than 100 requests per minute. The limit automatically resets after 1 minute.

Example: If you make 100 requests to the same endpoint within 15 seconds, you
will be able to continue 45 seconds later.
