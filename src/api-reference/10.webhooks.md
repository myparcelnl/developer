# 10. Webhooks

## 10.A Add subscription

### 10.A.1 Overview

Use this endpoint to subscribe to an event in our API. Upon success
an <Http code=200 /> with subscription ids is returned. You must use HTTPS for
callback because it's secure and tamper-proof. You can only have one webhook of
each type at a time for a shop so adding the same webhook overwrites any
existing one. We always send the webhook to a URL with lowercase characters.
Therefore, it is necessary to use lowercase characters in the URL of the webhook
call.

We currently have two available hooks: `shipment_status_change` and `shipment_label_created`:

* shipment_status_change: Whenever the [status](#shipment_status) of a shipment changes this webhook will send you an update with the new value. We will not send an update with a status 1.
* shipment_label_created: When a label is created asynchronously (for example when [creating shipments using accept header application/vnd.shipment_label+json;charset=utf-8](#6_B_2) ) this webhook will send you a message with the url of the label.

::: tip
You can test webhooks with [Webhook Tester](https://webhook.site/). You can also use the backoffice to update the webhook url.
