# 2. Responses

As stated earlier data is usually sent back in JSON format. Exceptions to this rule are shipment label, invoice and CSV export. Shipment label and invoice are sent back in PDF format while CSV export is sent back in CSV format. Usually a response will have a response body. Exceptions are DELETE requests which will only contain a status code (204) indicating success. A failed request with a 4xx status code will always send back a response body with the error description. A failed request with a 5xx status code will probably mean you've hit a snag in our API. We try to monitor these kind of errors, but if you keep having trouble... Don't hesitate to [reach out!](https://www.myparcel.nl/contact)

## 2.A HTTP statuses

HTTP status codes are used to indicate success or failure of a request. Here's a list of supported status codes. For a more comprehensive list of HTTP status codes [visit Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) or W3C.

Example of a 200 Status code in our API (you can try this in your browser, then you know our API is online)
