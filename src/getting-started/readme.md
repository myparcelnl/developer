You've come to the right place to create a connection with MyParcel. No matter
what connection you need, we're here to help you make it easier. Here are all
the ways you can make a connection with MyParcel and your webshop.

## Create a MyParcel account

1. Login or create an account on the [MyParcel backoffice]
2. An API key can be generated in [`Shop Settings -> General`]. You
   need this to connect to MyParcel.

## Connecting your CMS

To connect with a CMS, look for it on our [Integrations] page and read the
respective guide. The guides contain in-depth instructions on how to install,
configure and use each integration.

::: tip
If you have any plugin questions, you can contact our IT support department
through [support@myparcel.nl].

## Connecting with the MyParcel API

First, you should check [Integrations](/integrations/#sdks) to see if we have an
SDK for the programming language you want to use. In case we do, it can help you
get a head start on integrating with MyParcel, as most of the hard work is
already done.

If you still wish to create a custom integration, follow these steps:

1. Get your API key from the [MyParcel backoffice].
2. Follow the [authentication instructions].
3. Check out our [API reference] for examples and instructions on how to use our
   API and which requests you can make.

::: tip
If you have questions about our API, you can email [support@myparcel.nl], fill
in our [contact form], or ask our developers directly on [Slack].
