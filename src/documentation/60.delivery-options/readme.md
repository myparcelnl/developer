This is the MyParcel delivery options module for use in any e-commerce
platform's checkout, by [MyParcel](https://myparcel.nl/)
, [SendMyParcel](https://sendmyparcel.be/)
and [Flespakket](https://flespakket.nl/) customers. It's used to show your
customers the possible delivery and/or pickup options for their location, based
on your settings. It only has the bare minimum css styling so it should
integrate with the design of your webshop easily.
