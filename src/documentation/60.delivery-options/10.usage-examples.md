These examples assume you've already loaded the delivery options in your page.
See [Installation] if you haven't.
You have to provide a configuration file in the following format
as `window.MyParcelConfig` and initialize the delivery options with an event.

### Setting up the configuration

This is an example.

```js
window.MyParcelConfig = {
    config: {
        platform: 'belgie', // REQUIRED!
        carrierSettings: {
            bpost: {
                allowDeliveryOptions: true,
                allowPickupLocations: true,
            },
            dpd: {
                allowDeliveryOptions: true,
                allowPickupLocations: true,
            },
        },
    },
    address: {
        cc: 'BE',
        city: 'Antwerpen',
        postalCode: '2000',
    },
};

// Trigger this event on the document to tell the delivery options to update.
// Usually only needed on initializing and when the address changes.
document.dispatchEvent(new Event('myparcel_update_delivery_options'));
```

### Getting the address from your environment

1. Set up the link between the address fields and the delivery options:
   ```js
   /**
    * Get data from form fields and put it in the global MyParcelConfig.
    */
   function updateAddress() {
     window.MyParcelConfig.address = {
       cc: document.querySelector('#country').value,
       postalCode: document.querySelector('#house_number').value,
       number: document.querySelector('#postcode').value,
       city: document.querySelector('#address_1').value,
     };

     /*
      * Send the event that tells the delivery options module to reload data.
      */
     document.dispatchEvent(new Event('myparcel_update_delivery_options'));

     // IE9–11 compatible example
     var event = document.createEvent('HTMLEvents');
     event.initEvent('myparcel_update_delivery_options', true, false);
     document.querySelector('body').dispatchEvent(event);
   }
   ```
1. Add event listeners to each address field to execute this function:
    ```js
    // ES6 example, use var for older environments.
    const addressFields = [
      '<Country field selector>',
      '<Postal code field selector>',
      '<Address line 1 field selector>',
    ];

    addressFields.forEach((field) => {
      document.querySelector(field).addEventListener('change', updateAddress);
    });
    ```
1. Now, when an user changes the value in any of the fields set
   in `addressFields` the `window.MyParcelConfig` will be updated and the
   delivery options module will receive the event that tells it to update. The
   delivery options will reload and fetch the available options for the new
   address.

### Usage in forms

You'll often want to use the delivery options module in a checkout form in your
webshop software. Below are some things to keep in mind, but if you're
interested in doing this you should check out our Magento2 and WooCommerce
plugins locally and read through these implementations. You can find the best
files to get started with in [Integration examples]. We also recommend you join
our [Slack] support channel to get (fast!) answers to any questions you might
have.

1. Follow the steps in [Installation] and copy `myparcel.js` (Vue included)
   or `myparcel.lib.js` (Vue not included)
   from `node_modules/@myparcel/delivery-options/dist` to your js folder.
2. The things you'll need to do :

- Have either a `window.MyParcelConfig` or dispatch a `CustomEvent` with the
  settings you want in the page where you're loading the delivery options.
- Send events to the delivery options telling it when to update or rerender.
- Listen to the delivery options' events to update your application according
  to the changes.
- Attach the output data to the order that is being created.

### Allowing or disallowing settings for specific countries

Let's say you want to disallow delivery to the Netherlands, only allow pickup in
Belgium, for bpost. For DPD you want pickup only, wherever it's possible.

The configuration would look like this:

```js
window.MyParcelConfig = {
    config: {
        platform: 'belgie',
        carrierSettings: {
            bpost: {
                // Allow delivery options in all countries it's possible in except the Netherlands.
                allowDeliveryOptions: {allow: false, items: ['NL']},
                // Only allow pickup locations in Belgium.
                allowPickupLocations: {allow: true, items: ['BE']},
            },
            dpd: {
                allowDeliveryOptions: false,
                allowPickupLocations: true,
            }
        }
    }
};
```

This is currently only possible for `allowDeliveryOptions`
and `allowPickupLocations`. If you want this feature to be available for more
settings, please create a feature request. Or, if you want to do it yourself you
can send us a pull request!

### Using Instabox for same day delivery only

Use case: You always want to use PostNL for regular shipments, but if a same day
delivery is possible, you want to allow your customer to choose Instabox.

Example configuration:

```js
window.MyParcelConfig = {
    config: {
        platform: 'myparcel',
        allowSameDayDelivery: true,
        cutoffTimeSameDay: '8:30',
        deliveryDaysWindow: 7,
        dropOffDelay: 1,
        priceSameDayDelivery: 6.65,
        priceStandardDelivery: 4.95,
        carrierSettings: {
            // Carriers are shown in order of the carrierSettings object, so RJP will be above PostNL.
            instabox: {
                allowDeliveryOptions: true,
                deliveryDaysWindow: 1,
                dropOffDelay: 0,
            },
            postnl: {
                allowDeliveryOptions: true,
            }
        }
    }
};
```

The fields `deliveryDaysWindow` and `dropOffDelay`
inside `carrierSettings.instabox` are very important here. This setup would give
you the following logic:

> **Current day and time: Tuesday, 6:45**
> - Instabox
    >   - The only option is today, which costs € 6.65.
> - PostNL
    >   - First option: Tomorrow, standard delivery, € 4.95.
    >

- The next 6 valid days are also available.

> **Current day and time: Tuesday, 14:30**
> - PostNL
    >   - First option: Tomorrow, standard delivery, € 4.95.
    >

- The next 6 valid days are also available.

##### Our Magento 2 implementation

Files that can help you get started:

Note: It's more complex in Magento 2 because of the way shipping methods work.

-

Backend: [/Model/Checkout/DeliveryOptionsToShippingMethods.php](https://github.com/myparcelnl/magento/blob/develop/Model/Checkout/DeliveryOptionsToShippingMethods.php)
-
Frontend: [/view/frontend/web/js/view/delivery-options.js](https://github.com/myparcelnl/magento/blob/develop/view/frontend/web/js/view/delivery-options.js)

#### Attach data to an order using a hidden input

In WooCommerce and Magento 2 we injected a hidden text input inside the
checkout `<form>` elements to hold this data and automatically pass it to
the `$_POST` variable.

```js
// Listen to the CustomEvent the delivery option sends back out once its data has been updated
document.addEventListener('myparcel_updated_delivery_options', (event) => {
    myHiddenInput.value = JSON.stringify(event.detail);

    // And now trigger updating the checkout of whatever platform you're using.
    // WooCommerce example:
    document.dispatchEvent(new Event('update_checkout'));

    // In Magento 2 we would update quote.shippingMethod here to trigger the changes.
});
```

#### Deselect options

You might want to integrate the delivery options into a list of existing
shipping methods, like we've done
in [Magento 2](https://github.com/myparcelnl/magento/blob/504ea103f6b3042e1dfa7debc022251eeaba381e/view/frontend/web/js/view/delivery-options.js#L231)
. So when the user selects a different shipping method you'll want the delivery
options to appear unselected.

<MPImg src="/documentation/delivery-options/deselect-1.png" alt="Deselect 1" />

Note: If you only have one option, so either "delivery" or "pickup", the option
will appear disabled. Until there's a built in solution, there's the following
workaround.

If you only use delivery:

```js
document.getElementById('myparcel-delivery-options__delivery--deliver').disabled = false;
```

If you only use pickup:

```js
document.getElementById('myparcel-delivery-options__delivery--pickup').disabled = false;
```

<MPImg src="/documentation/delivery-options/deselect-2.png" alt="Deselect 2" />

To deselect all options, dispatch the `myparcel_disable_delivery_options` event.
You could do this as when your users select a different shipping method, for
example.

```js
document.dispatchEvent(new Event('myparcel_disable_delivery_options'));
```

The delivery options will look like this:

<MPImg src="/documentation/delivery-options/deselect-3.png" alt="Deselect 3" />
