4. Make your changes conforming to our code style

- We recommend enabling ESLint in your editor to make this easier.
- Add/update unit tests if necessary.

5. Commit, keeping the following rules in mind:

- We use [Conventional Commits] and [semantic-release] to simplify the process
  of releasing updates by automating release notes and changelogs based on the
  rules of [@commitlint/config-conventional].
- If your commit messages aren't formatted according to these rules, Git hooks
  will prevent you from committing your changes.

6. Create a pull request

- Keep your pull requests focused on single subjects.
- Please explain what you changed and why.
- We will check your code and thoroughly test it before merging.
