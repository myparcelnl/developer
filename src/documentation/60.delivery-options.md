This is the documentation for the stable version of the Delivery Options. If you're looking for the documentation for the legacy (5.x) version, please see the [delivery options 5.x documentation](./61.delivery-options-5).
:::

## Introduction

This is the MyParcel delivery options module for use in any e-commerce platform's checkout, by [MyParcel] and [SendMyParcel] customers. It's used to show your customers the possible delivery and/or pickup options for their location, based on your settings.

## Installation

First, you need to add the delivery options script to your page. You can do this using your favorite package manager or by including the script from the CDN in your HTML.

- [Option 1: CDN](#option-1-cdn)
- [Option 2: Install via package manager](#option-2-install-via-package-manager)

### Option 1: CDN

This is the easiest way. Include Vue 3 and the `@myparcel/delivery-options` JavaScript and CSS from the CDN in your HTML.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@3.4"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@myparcel/delivery-options@6/dist/myparcel.lib.js"></script>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@myparcel/delivery-options@6/dist/style.css" />
```

Or, when there is already a different version of Vue on the page, you can use a compiled version of the delivery options that includes Vue. This way you can avoid conflicts between Vue versions.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@myparcel/delivery-options@6/dist/myparcel.js"></script>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@myparcel/delivery-options@6/dist/style.css" />
```

::: tip
Continue to [usage](#usage) to see how to initialize the delivery options.
:::

### Option 2: Install via package manager

Install the package using your favorite package manager.

<InstallNode package="@myparcel/delivery-options" />

And include the script and CSS in your project.

```js
import '@myparcel/delivery-options/dist/myparcel.js';
import '@myparcel/delivery-options/dist/style.css';
```

::: tip
Continue to [usage](#usage) to see how to initialize the delivery options.

## Usage

If you're using Vue 3, you can use the Vue component. If you're using plain JavaScript, you can use the plain JavaScript version.

- [Vue 3](#usage-option-1-vue-3)
- [Plain JavaScript](#usage-option-2-plain-javascript)

### Usage option 1: Vue 3

When you're developing in an existing Vue 3 app, you can use the Vue component instead. This is the easiest way to use the delivery options. See the [configuration](#configuration) section for all possible options. You can use the [smallest possible configuration](#smallest-possible-configuration) as an example and/or starting point.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import {ref, type Ref} from 'vue';
import {
  MyParcelDeliveryOptions,
  type InputDeliveryOptionsConfiguration,
} from '@myparcel/delivery-options/lib';

const configuration: Ref<InputDeliveryOptionsConfiguration> = ref({
  // Your configuration here
  address: {
    cc: 'NL',
    postalCode: '2132JE',
    number: '31',
    street: 'Antareslaan 31',
    city: 'Hoofddorp',
  },
  strings: {
    // Translations
  },
  config: {
    platform: 'myparcel',
    carrierSettings: {
      postnl: {},
    },
  },
});
</script>

<style>
@import '@myparcel/delivery-options/style.css';
</style>

<template>
  <MyParcelDeliveryOptions :configuration="configuration" />
</template>
```

::: tip
Continue to the [configuration](#configuration) section to see all possible options.
:::

### Usage option 2: Plain JavaScript

Create a wrapper div in your html where you want the delivery options to appear.

```html
<div id="myparcel-delivery-options"></div>
```

Then, initialize the delivery options with your configuration. See the [configuration](#configuration) section for all possible options. For now, we will use the [smallest possible configuration](#smallest-possible-configuration) as an example.

```js
const configuration = {
  // This is the default selector, you can change it to any CSS selector you want. Make sure it only selects one element.
  selector: '#myparcel-delivery-options',
  address: {
    cc: 'NL',
    postalCode: '2132JE',
    number: '31',
    street: 'Antareslaan 31',
    city: 'Hoofddorp',
  },
  config: {
    platform: 'myparcel',
    carrierSettings: {
      postnl: {},
    },
  },
};

document.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent('myparcel_update_delivery_options', {detail: configuration}),
);
```

::: tip
See the [configuration](#configuration) section to see all possible options.
:::

To retrieve the selected delivery options, you can listen for the `myparcel_updated_delivery_options` event.

```js
document.addEventListener('myparcel_updated_delivery_options', (event) => {
  console.log(event.detail);
});
```

When you change your selection in the rendered delivery options, the event will be fired with the new selection.
Example output:

```json lines
{
  "carrier": "postnl",
  "date": "2024-04-10 00:00:00.000000",
  "deliveryType": "morning",
  "isPickup": false,
  "packageType": "package",
  "shipmentOptions": {
    "signature": true,
    "onlyRecipient": true
  }
}
```

This can then be used to update the shipping costs in your checkout.

### Error events

Whenever the selections in the rendered delivery options output an error, the following event will be fired:
Example output:

```json lines
{ 
  "exception": {
    "code": 3501,
    "label": "error3501",
    "status": 422,
    "title": "Street cannot be parsed",
    "message": "Street cannot be parsed"
  }
}
```

To retrieve the error, you can listen for the `myparcel_error_delivery_options` event.

```js
document.addEventListener('myparcel_error_delivery_options', (event) => {
  console.log(event.detail);
});
```

## Configuration

Almost all settings can be set globally or per carrier. If you set a setting globally, it will be used for all carriers unless you override it for a specific carrier. How you should pass the configuration to the delivery options depends on whether you're using the Vue component or plain JavaScript. See the [usage](#usage) section for more information.

::: tip
For the most comprehensive information, you can check out our [Sandbox]. Here you can see (and try) all the possible configuration options and see the result in real-time.
:::

### Delivery types

There are four types of delivery options: standard delivery, same day delivery, morning delivery, and evening delivery. You can enable or disable them separately.

```json
{
  "allowDeliveryOptions": true,
  "allowStandardDelivery": false,
  "allowMorningDelivery": true,
  "allowEveningDelivery": true,
  "allowSameDayDelivery": false
}
```

This configuration will show only morning and evening delivery options.

### Cutoff times and drop off days

Drop off days are the days on which you can drop off your parcels at the carrier. This is used to calculate the delivery date. They can be entered in a couple of different ways.

**As a string or array of numbers**

```json lines
{
  "cutoffTime": "16:00",
  "sameDayCutoffTime": "9:30",
  "dropOffDays": "1,2,3,4,5",
  // or
  "dropOffDays": "1;2;3",
  // or
  "dropOffDays": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

In this example, all drop off days will use the `cutoffTime` and the `sameDayCutoffTime` from the root of the configuration, so `16:00` and `9:30` respectively.

**As an array of objects and/or numbers**

```json
{
  "cutoffTime": "15:00",
  "sameDayCutoffTime": "9:30",
  "dropOffDays": [
    1,
    {
      "day": 2,
      "cutoffTime": "16:00",
      "sameDayCutoffTime": "10:00"
    },
    {
      "day": 3
    },
    {
      "day": 5,
      "cutoffTime": "14:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example the drop-off days are as follows:

| Day       | Cutoff time     | Same day cutoff time |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Monday    | 15:00 (default) | 9:30 (default)       |
| Tuesday   | 16:00           | 10:00                |
| Wednesday | 15:00 (default) | 9:30 (default)       |
| Friday    | 14:00           | 9:30 (default)       |

### Smallest possible configuration

Most keys of the config are optional. The only required keys are:

- `platform`: `"myparcel"` or `"sendmyparcel"`
- `carrierSettings`: an object with at least one carrier identifier as a key.

The full address is always required.

```json lines
{
  "address": {
    "cc": "NL",
    "postalCode": "2132JE",
    "number": "31",
    "street": "Antareslaan 31",
    "city": "Hoofddorp" // optional in some cases, but strongly recommended
  },
  "config": {
    "platform": "myparcel",
    // Global settings for all carriers that do not override them go here
    "carrierSettings": {
      "postnl": {
        // Carrier-specific settings for postnl go here
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All delivery types and options are enabled by default. This has the following result:

### Full configuration reference

These are all the possible configuration options. The `strings` object is used for translations. The `config` object is used for all other settings.

```json lines

  // string, CSS selector for the element where the delivery options will be rendered. Optional, defaults to "#myparcel-delivery-options".
  "selector": "#myparcel-delivery-options",

## Upgrading

### v5 to v6

The app was rewritten from scratch to be able to upgrade all underlying technologies and to improve the performance and stability. The existing behavior will mostly continue to work, so you can upgrade to v6 without huge changes. However, there are some breaking changes and deprecations, so please read the following list carefully.

#### New features

- It's now possible to set separate cutoff times per day and per carrier.
- Package type `package_small` is now supported.
- You can now pass custom cutoff times per day (and optionally per carrier).
- It's now possible to disable standard delivery but keep showing morning and/or evening delivery.

#### Other improvements

- A beautiful new design.
- Vastly improved performance and stability.
- The app can now be used as a Vue component in any Vue 3 app.
- TypeScript support.
- Many more exported methods, constants, types and interfaces.

#### Breaking changes

- It's no longer possible to set `showDeliveryDate` per carrier. This is now a global setting only.
- The CSS is no longer bundled, so you must manually include `dist/style.css`. This does not apply if you're using the Vue component.
- The `unselect_delivery_options` event has been removed. If you need this feature, please [let us know].

#### Deprecated

- `cutoffTime` is deprecated, use `dropOffDays` instead
- Rather than relying on `allowDeliveryOptions` only, use `allowStandardDelivery` as well.

::: note
The existing behavior will continue to work throughout v6 but will be removed/changed in the next major version.
:::

#### Notable internal changes

- The app is now fully written in TypeScript.
- Upgraded from Vue 2 to Vue 3.
- Upgraded from Vue CLI to Vite.
- Upgraded from Jest to Vitest.
