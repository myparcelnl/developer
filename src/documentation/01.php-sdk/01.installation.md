# Installation

## Requirements

The MyParcel SDK works with PHP version >= 7.1.

If you have a PHP version lower than 7.1 then we would like to advise you to update your PHP version to
a [supported versions](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php). For support for PHP version 5.6 you can use
release [2.x](https://github.com/myparcelnl/sdk/releases/tag/v2.1.5).

## Installation with Composer

This SDK uses Composer. Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your
project depends on, and it will manage (install/update) them for you. For more information on how to use
composer, please visit [the Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/)

To install the MyParcel SDK into your project, simply use

```shell
composer require myparcelnl/sdk
```

You can then start using our classes in the namespace `MyParcelNL/Sdk`. See [Examples](./02.examples/01.create-consignment.md) to get started.
