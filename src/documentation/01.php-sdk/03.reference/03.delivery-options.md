# Delivery options from the checkout with adapters

You can use `DeliveryOptionsAdapterFactory` if you use the following code in your
checkout: [Delivery Options](https://github.com/myparcelnl/delivery-options)
You can use these adapters to receive the options anywhere in your code in a consistent way. If you also have the
options in a different format, you can also make your own adapter.

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Adapter\DeliveryOptions\DeliveryOptionsFromOrderAdapter;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Factory\DeliveryOptionsAdapterFactory;

try {
	// Create new instance from known json
	$deliveryOptions = DeliveryOptionsAdapterFactory::create(json_decode($dataFromCheckout));
} catch (BadMethodCallException $e) {
	// Create new instance from your own data
	$deliveryOptions = new DeliveryOptionsFromOrderAdapter(null, (array) $meta);
}
```

Adapters are independent of consignments. It is therefore your responsibility to transform an adapter into a
consignment.
