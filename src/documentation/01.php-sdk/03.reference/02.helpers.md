#### MyParcelCollection

Stores all consignments to communicate with the MyParcel API. MyParcelCollection also contains
almost [all methods](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/collections) from Laravel Collections. If you use Laravel it also
extends `\Illuminate\Support\Collection`.

`MyParcelNL/Sdk/src/Helper/MyParcelCollection.php`

```php
    // Add consignment to collection
    ->addConsignment() 
    // Generate the return consignments based on already added consignments
    ->generateReturnConsignments() 

    // Get consignments from the collection
    ->getConsignments()
    ->getConsignmentByApiId()
    ->getConsignmentsByReferenceIdentifier()

    // Clear the collection
    ->clearConsignmentsCollection()

    // Create or delete concept shipments in the MyParcel Backoffice
    ->createConcepts()
    ->deleteConcepts()
    
    ->getOneConsignment()
    ->getRequestBody()
    
    // Send return label to customer. The customer can pay and download the label
    ->sendReturnLabelMails()
    // Set id and run this function to update all the information about this shipment 
    ->setLatestData() 
    
    ->setLinkOfLabels()
    ->getLinkOfLabels()

    // Refer to 
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels()
    
    // To give us insight into which CMS system you're connecting from, you should send a User-Agent. 
    // If you're using a known CMS system it's required. 
    // You must send the name of the CMS system (required) followed by a version number (optional).
    ->setUserAgents(['name_of_cms', '1.0'])
    ->getUserAgent()
```
