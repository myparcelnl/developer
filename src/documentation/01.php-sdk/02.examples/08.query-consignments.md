# Query consignments

You can search and filter consignments by certain values:

```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::query(
    'api_key_from_backoffice',
    [
        'q'                    => 'Niels',
        'reference_identifier' => 'order-1234',
        'status'               => 2,
        'from'                 => '2020-01-01 00:00:00',
        'to'                   => '2020-02-01 00:00:00',
        'page'                 => 1,
        'size'                 => 200,
        'order'                => 'DESC',
        'package_type'         => 1,
        'region'               => 'NL;EU',
        'dropoff_today'        => 1,
    ]
);
```

For `q` and `reference identifier` you can use `*` (wildcards) to search smarter.

::: tip

If the 2nd parameter is an object, then public properties will be used. If you query in many ways, creating a separate class can provide a clean solution.
