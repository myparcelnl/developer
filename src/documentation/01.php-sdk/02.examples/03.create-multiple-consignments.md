# Create multiple consignments

This example creates multiple consignments by adding them to one `MyParcelCollection()` and then creates and
downloads one PDF with all labels.

```php
// Create the collection before the loop
$consignments = (new MyParcelCollection())
    ->setUserAgents(['name_of_cms', '1.0']); 

// Loop through your shipments, adding each to the same MyParcelCollection()
foreach ($yourShipments as $yourShipment) {

    $consignment = ((ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID))
        ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
        ->setReferenceIdentifier($yourShipment['reference_id'])
        ->setPerson($yourShipment['name'])
        ->setPostalCode($yourShipment['postal_code'])
        ->setFullStreet($yourShipment['full_street']) 
        ->setCity($yourShipment['city'])
    );
        
    // Add each consignment to the collection created before
    $consignments
        ->addConsignment($consignment);
}
```
