# Create and download label(s)

Create and directly download PDF with `setPdfOfLabels($position)` where `$positions` is
the [label position](./05.label-format-and-position.md) value.

```php
$consignments
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    // Opens pdf "inline" by default, pass false as argument to download file instead
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels(false); 
```

Create and echo download link to PDF with `setLinkOfLabels($position)` where `$positions` is
the [label position](./05.label-format-and-position.md) value. If you want more than 25 labels in one response,
`setLinkOfLabels` will automatically use a different endpoint. At that point, it is likely that the PDF is not ready
yet. You should check periodically if the PDF is ready for download.

```php
echo $consignments 
    ->setLinkOfLabels($positions)
    ->getLinkOfLabels();
```

If you want to download a label at a later time, you can also use the following to fill the collection:

```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::findByReferenceIdentifier('order-146', 'api_key_from_backoffice');
$consignments
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels();
```

Instead of `findByReferenceIdentifier()` you can also use `findManyByReferenceIdentifier()`, `find()` or `findMany()`.
