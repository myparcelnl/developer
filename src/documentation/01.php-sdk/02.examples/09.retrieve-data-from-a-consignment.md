title: Retrieve data from a consignment

# Retrieve data from a consignment

Most attributes that have a `set<Attribute>()` method also have a `get<Attribute>()` method to retrieve the data.
View [all methods](../03.reference/01.models.md#postnlconsignment) for consignments here.

```php
$consignment = new PostNLConsignment();

echo $consignment->getFullStreet();
echo $consignment->getPerson();
echo $consignment->getPhone();
echo $consignment->getStreet();
// etc...
```

#### Get status

After `setPdfOfLabels()`, `setLinkOfLabels()` and `createConcepts()` you can get the status.

```php
$status = $consignment->getStatus();
```

#### Get barcode

The barcode is available after `setPdfOfLabels()` and `setLinkOfLabels()`

```php
$barcode = $consignment->getBarcode();
```

#### Get Track & Trace url

The Track & Trace url is available after `downloadPdfOfLabels()` and `getLinkOfLabels()`

```php
$consignment = (new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment());
echo $consignment->getBarcodeUrl('3SMYPA123456789', '2231JE', 'NL'); // Barcode , Postal code, Country
```
