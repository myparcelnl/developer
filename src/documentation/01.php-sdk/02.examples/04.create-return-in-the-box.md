# Create return in the box

This example creates a consignment and a related return consignment by adding them to one `MyParcelCollection()` and
then creates and downloads a single PDF file with both labels.

```php
// Create the collection before the loop
$consignments = new MyParcelCollection();

// Loop through your shipments, adding each to the same MyParcelCollection()
foreach ($yourShipments as $yourShipment) {

    $consignment = ((ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID))
        ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
        ->setCountry($yourShipment['cc'])
        ->setPerson($yourShipment['person'])
        ->setCompany($yourShipment['company'])
        ->setFullStreet($yourShipment['full_street_input'])
        ->setPostalCode($yourShipment['postal_code'])
        ->setCity($yourShipment['city'])
        ->setLabelDescription($yourShipment['label_description'])
    );
        
    // Add the consignment to the collection and generate the return consignment
    // When there are no options set, the options from the parent consignment are used
    $consignments
        ->addConsignment($consignment)
        ->generateReturnConsignments(
            false,
            function (
                AbstractConsignment $returnConsignment,
                AbstractConsignment $parent
            ): AbstractConsignment {
                $returnConsignment->setLabelDescription(
                    'Return: ' . $parent->getLabelDescription() .
                    ' This label is valid until: ' . date("d-m-Y", strtotime("+ 28 days"))
                );
                $returnConsignment->setSignature(true);

                return $returnConsignment;
            }
        );
}
```
