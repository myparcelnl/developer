# Find consignments

After creating consignments, it is often necessary to pick up a specific consignment:

```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::find(432345);
```

Instead of `find()` you can also use `findMany()`, `findByReferenceIdentifier()` or `findManyByReferenceIdentifier()`.

For `reference identifier` you can use a `*` to search smarter:

```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::findByReferenceIdentifier('order-14*');
```
