## Endpoints

### Public

Public endpoints do not require authorization and are safe to use in a browser.

- Delivery options
  - [GetDeliveryOptions](./src/endpoints/public/delivery-options/GetDeliveryOptions.ts)
- Pickup locations
  - [GetPickupLocations](./src/endpoints/public/pickup-locations/GetPickupLocations.ts)
- Carriers
  - [GetCarriers](./src/endpoints/public/carriers/GetCarriers.ts)
  - [GetCarrier](./src/endpoints/public/carriers/GetCarrier.ts)

### Private

Private endpoints require an Authorization header. This should be a base64
encoded MyParcel API key. You can create one in the shop settings in
our [backoffice]. See [Authorization] in the API documentation for more
information.

- Shipments
  - [GetShipment](./src/endpoints/private/shipments/GetShipment.ts)
  - [GetShipments](./src/endpoints/private/shipments/GetShipments.ts)
