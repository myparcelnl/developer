The PDK backend is a PHP library that contains all the logic for building a MyParcel plugin. It contains everything from the API communication to the logic for rendering the frontend components. It is built to be framework-agnostic and extremely extensible, so you can implement it in any PHP application. The PDK backend is built on top of [PHP-DI](https://php-di.org/), so it uses [dependency injection](#core-concepts) to make it easy to extend and configure.

::: tip
The PDK backend is currently only available in PHP, but we intend on creating a Node.js version as well.

If this is something you would like to use, [please tell us](/contact.md)! This will help us prioritize building it.
:::

## Prerequisites

For the backend to work, you need to have the following installed:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 7.4 or higher
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

If you intend on using the frontend, you will also need to have the following installed:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) 16 or higher (Lower versions may work, but this is not tested)

## Installation

Install [myparcelnl/pdk] using [Composer]:

```bash
composer require myparcelnl/pdk
```

## Core concepts

### Terminology

See [the terminology section](./readme.md#terminology) for a list of generic terms used throughout the PDK and this documentation.

::: expand h3: Dependency injection

The PDK backend uses [PHP-DI](https://php-di.org/) for dependency injection. This means that you can use constructor injection to get access to the PDK backend's services. This is done through the [`Pdk`](https://github.com/myparcelnl/pdk/blob/main/src/Facade/Pdk.php) Facade.

To read more about dependency injection, see the [PHP-DI documentation](https://php-di.org/doc/understanding-di.html).

:::

::: expand h3: Facades

Facades are the main way to interact with the PDK. They provide a static interface to the underlying classes, which allows you to use them without having to instantiate them first. This is especially useful for classes that are used in many places, such as the `Logger`. The facades cannot be used until the PDK has been instantiated.

The following facades are available:

- [`\MyParcelNL\Pdk\Facade\AccountSettings`](https://github.com/myparcelnl/pdk/blob/main/src/Facade/AccountSettings.php)
- [`\MyParcelNL\Pdk\Facade\Actions`](https://github.com/myparcelnl/pdk/blob/main/src/Facade/Actions.php)

::: expand h3: Actions

Actions are the core of all functionality. They are used for all behaviour in the plugin. Actions are divided into three categories:

**Frontend actions**: Actions that are used in the frontend of your platform. These actions are used to communicate with the PDK backend and are used to render and update the frontend.

**Backend actions**: Actions that are used in the backend of your platform. These actions are used to communicate with the MyParcel API and are needed for all functionality.

**Shared actions**: Actions that can be used in both the frontend and backend of your platform.

#### Backend actions

| Domain           | Action                  | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

::: expand h3: Frontend

Use the [`\MyParcelNL\Pdk\Facade\Frontend`] facade to render the admin frontend. The frontend is divided into components, which can be rendered individually. The following components are available:

#### Admin: InitScript

Render the init script component. This component is responsible for initializing the javascript code needed to render the frontend.

```php
Frontend::renderInitScript(): string
```

#### Admin: Modals

The modals component renders all modals used in the frontend. This includes the settings modal and the order modal.

```php
Frontend::renderModals(): string
```

#### Admin: Notifications

Render the notifications component. This component is responsible for rendering the notifications reported by other parts of the frontend.

```php
Frontend::renderNotifications(): string
```

#### Admin: OrderBox

The order box is responsible for rendering detailed MyParcel information for a single order view. It contains a form to edit the delivery options and a table with created shipments.

```php
Frontend::renderOrderBox(PdkOrder $order): string
```

#### Admin: OrderListItem

The order list item is responsible for rendering MyParcel information for each order in the order list/grid of your app.

```php
Frontend::renderOrderListItem(PdkOrder $order): string
```

#### Admin: PluginSettings

```php
Frontend::renderPluginSettings(): string
```

#### Admin: ProductSettings

```php
Frontend::renderProductSettings(PdkProduct $product): string
```

#### Checkout: DeliveryOptions

Renders the delivery options component. This component is responsible for rendering the delivery options in the checkout.

```php
Frontend::renderDeliveryOptions(PdkCart $cart): string
```

## Implementation

To use the PDK backend, you first need to instantiate it. This needs to happen before any of the Facades can be used.

In the following examples, we're building a plugin for WordPress with WooCommerce, so we're prefixing all classes with `Wc`. You should replace this with your own prefix. This makes it easier to distinguish between your own classes and the PDK classes.

::: tip
ðŸ“š For more in-depth examples and to see the whole thing in action, check out our actual [WooCommerce plugin](https://github.com/myparcelnl/woocommerce/tree/alpha), which is built with the PDK.
:::

### Configuration

First, you should create a config file. We recommend you copy the [template configuration] and place it in `<your-project>/config/pdk.php`. This template contains all classes you should extend to implement the PDK in your platform. Make sure to check each interface to see what it does and how to implement it.

For example, to define your `WcOrderRepository`, create a class that extends `AbstractPdkOrderRepository` and implement all abstract methods:

```php
use MyParcelNL\Pdk\Plugin\Repository\AbstractPdkOrderRepository;
use MyParcelNL\Pdk\Plugin\Model\PdkOrder;

class WcOrderRepository extends AbstractPdkOrderRepository
{
    public function get($input): PdkOrder
    {
        return $this->retrieve((string) $order->id, function () use ($order) {
            return new PdkOrder([
                // map your order data to PDK order data
            ]);
        });
    }
}
```

And then reference it in your PDK configuration:

```php
return [
    // ...
    PdkOrderRepositoryInterface::class => autowire(MyPlatformPdkOrderRepository::class),
];
```

Repeat this for all required classes and any other classes you want to implement yourself. Keep in mind you must only extend interfaces, never classes.

### Creating the bootstrapper

The `PdkBootstrapper` is responsible for instantiating the PDK. You can extend it to add your own configuration. For example, to add your own configuration to the PDK, you can extend the `getAdditionalConfig` method:

```php
use MyParcelNL\Pdk\Base\Pdk;
use MyParcelNL\Pdk\Base\PdkBootstrapper;

namespace MyCompany\MyApp\Pdk\Base;

class WcPdkBootstrapper extends PdkBootstrapper
{
    protected function getAdditionalConfig(
        string $name,
        string $title,
        string $version,
        string $path,
        string $url
    ): array {
        return [
            'mode'      => value(WP_DEBUG ? Pdk::MODE_DEVELOPMENT : Pdk::MODE_PRODUCTION),
            'userAgent' => value([
                // User agents should be sorted from most specific to least specific.
                'MyParcelNL-WooCommerce' => $version,
                'WooCommerce'            => defined('WOOCOMMERCE_VERSION')
                    ? constant('WOOCOMMERCE_VERSION')
                    : '?',
                'WordPress'              => get_bloginfo('version'),
            ]),

            // Here you can add any additional config you want to pass to the DI container.
        ];
    }
}
```

This allows for easy access to the plugin name, title, version, path and URL. You can use this file along with the config file to instantiate the PDK. We recommend you put all interface overrides in the config file and all other configuration in the bootstrapper.

### Instantiating the PDK

Now you can call the bootstrapper to instantiate the PDK:

```php
// <plugin>/myparcelnl-woocommerce.php

use MyParcelNL\WooCommerce\Pdk\WcPdkBootstrapper;

class MyParcelNL {
    public function __construct() {
        WcPdkBootstrapper::boot(
            'myparcelnl',              // Name of the plugin
            'MyParcel',                // Title; will be shown in the admin panel
            $this->getVersion(),       // Plugin version from composer.json
            plugin_dir_path(__FILE__), // Plugin path
            plugin_dir_url(__FILE__)   // Plugin URL
        );
    }
    // ...
}

new MyParcelNL();
```

This bootstraps the PDK and is required before you can use any functionality. This will allow you to use all facades and the service container in your own code as well. For example, to use our new `WcOrderRepository` class:

```php
use MyParcelNL\Pdk\App\Order\Contract\PdkOrderRepositoryInterface;

/** @var PdkOrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository */
$orderRepository = Pdk::get(PdkOrderRepositoryInterface::class);

$order = $orderRepository->get(1); // PdkOrder
```

Or via constructor injection:

```php
use MyParcelNL\Pdk\App\Order\Contract\PdkOrderRepositoryInterface;

class MyClass {
    private PdkOrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository;

    public function __construct(PdkOrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository) {
        $this->orderRepository = $orderRepository;
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Setting up the PDK API

::: note
If you do not intend to use the frontend, you can skip this step.
:::

The `EndpointActionsInterface` interface has the following methods:

```php
public function all(): Collection;
public function getBaseUrl(): string;
public function getEndpoints(): Collection;
```

When using `PdkEndpointActions`, `all` and `getEndpoints` are already implemented. That means you will only need to implement the `getBaseUrl` method. This method should return a full URL to your endpoint, without a trailing slash.

For example:

```php
class MyCustomEndpointActions extends \MyParcelNL\Pdk\Plugin\Action\PdkEndpointActions
{
    public function getBaseUrl(): string
    {
        return 'https://' . MY_DOMAIN . '/my-myparcel-pdk-endpoint';
    }
}
```

Now you need to register this class in your PDK [configuration]:

```php
// config/pdk.php
return [
    // ...
    EndpointActionsInterface::class => autowire(MyCustomEndpointActions::class),
];
```

This allows the PDK to use your custom endpoint for all PDK API calls. Do not forget to implement the endpoint itself. This depends on your platform and is out of scope for this documentation.

::: note
Note that you should never use the exact class names when injecting dependencies. Always use the interface.
:::

### Next steps

Create all required classes and register them in your [PDK configuration](#configuration). You can now use the PDK in your own code. To continue with the frontend part of the application, see the [PDK frontend documentation].
