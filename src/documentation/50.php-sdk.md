## Installation

### Requirements

The MyParcel SDK works with PHP version >= 7.1.

If you have a PHP version lower than 7.1 then we would like to advise you to
update your PHP version to
a [supported version](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php). For support
for PHP version 5.6 you can use [release 2.x].

### Installation with Composer

This SDK uses Composer. Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It
allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on, and it will
manage (install/update) them for you. For more information on how to use
composer, please visit [the Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/)

To install the MyParcel SDK into your project, simply use

```shell
composer require myparcelnl/sdk
```

You can then start using our classes in the namespace `MyParcelNL/Sdk`.

## Examples

### Create a consignment

This example uses only the required methods to create a shipment and download
its label.

```php
$consignment = (ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID))
    ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
    ->setReferenceIdentifier('order-146')
    ->setCountry('NL')
    ->setPerson('Piet Hier')
    ->setFullStreet('Plein 1945 55b')
    ->setPostalCode('2231JE')
    ->setCity('Amsterdam')
    ->setEmail('piet.hier@test.nl')
    ->setLabelDescription('Order 146');

$consignments = (new MyParcelCollection())
    ->addConsignment($consignment)
    ->setPdfOfLabels();

$consignmentId = $consignments->first()->getConsignmentId();

$consignments->downloadPdfOfLabels();
```

### Using multiple carriers

It is possible to use multiple carriers. The following carriers are supported:

| ID  | Name   | Carrier class                 | Consignment class                     |
| --- | ------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1   | PostNL | `Model\Carrier\CarrierPostNL` | `Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment` |
| 2   | Bpost  | `Model\Carrier\CarrierBpost`  | `Model\Consignment\BpostConsignment`  |
| 3   | DPD    | `Model\Carrier\CarrierDPD`    | `Model\Consignment\DPDConsignment`    |

You can query which carriers are available
like this:

```php
$options = (new CarrierOptionsWebService())
    ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
    ->getCarrierOptions('shop_id');
```

You can get the required `shop_id` from `AccountWebService`, the only shop
returned will be the shop belonging to the API key that is used. Since
the `shop_id` will not change unless the API key changes, we advise you to store
the `shop_id` until the user updates the API key.

```php
$shopId = (new AccountWebService())
    ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
    ->getAccount()
    ->getShops()
    ->first()
    ->getId();
```

### Create a consignment for each carrier manually

```php
$postNL   = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment();
$bpost    = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\Model\Consignment\BpostConsignment();
$dpd      = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\Model\Consignment\DPDConsignment();
```

Or by using `Factory\ConsignmentFactory` with a carrier ID or name, making it
easier to dynamically instantiate a consignment:

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Factory\ConsignmentFactory;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Carrier\CarrierBpost;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Carrier\CarrierPostNL;

$postNL = ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(CarrierPostNL::getId());
$bpost  = ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierName(CarrierBpost::getName());
```

### Create multiple consignments

This example creates multiple consignments by adding them to
one `MyParcelCollection()` and then creates and downloads one PDF with all
labels.

```php
// Create the collection before the loop
$consignments = (new MyParcelCollection())
    ->setUserAgents(['name_of_cms', '1.0']);

// Loop through your shipments, adding each to the same MyParcelCollection
foreach ($yourShipments as $yourShipment) {
    $consignment = ((ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID))
        ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
        ->setReferenceIdentifier($yourShipment['reference_id'])
        ->setPerson($yourShipment['name'])
        ->setPostalCode($yourShipment['postal_code'])
        ->setFullStreet($yourShipment['full_street'])
        ->setCity($yourShipment['city'])
    );

    // Add each consignment to the collection created before
    $consignments
        ->addConsignment($consignment);
}
```

### Create return-in-the-box

This example creates a consignment and a related return consignment by adding
them to one `MyParcelCollection()` and then creates and downloads a single PDF
file with both labels.

```php
// Create the collection before the loop
$consignments = new MyParcelCollection();

// Loop through your shipments, adding each to the same MyParcelCollection
foreach ($yourShipments as $yourShipment) {
    $consignment = ((ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID))
        ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
        ->setCountry($yourShipment['cc'])
        ->setPerson($yourShipment['person'])
        ->setCompany($yourShipment['company'])
        ->setFullStreet($yourShipment['full_street_input'])
        ->setPostalCode($yourShipment['postal_code'])
        ->setCity($yourShipment['city'])
        ->setLabelDescription($yourShipment['label_description'])
    );

    // Add the consignment to the collection and generate the return consignment
    // When there are no options set, the options from the parent consignment are used
    $consignments
        ->addConsignment($consignment)
        ->generateReturnConsignments(
            false,
            function (
                AbstractConsignment $returnConsignment,
                AbstractConsignment $parent
            ): AbstractConsignment {
                $returnConsignment->setLabelDescription(
                    'Return: ' . $parent->getLabelDescription() .
                    ' This label is valid until: ' . date("d-m-Y", strtotime("+ 28 days"))
                );
                $returnConsignment->setSignature(true);

                return $returnConsignment;
            }
        );
}
```

### Label format and position

Choose to output the label as either A4 or A6 when creating a pdf or download
link with the argument `$positions` of `setPdfOfLabels($positions)`
and `setLinkOfLabels($positions)`.

Example values for `$positions`:

```
A4:            A6:
┏━━━━━┳━━━━━┓  ┏━━━━━┓
┃  1  ┃  2  ┃  ┃  x  ┃
┣━━━━━╋━━━━━┫  ┗━━━━━┛
┃  3  ┃  4  ┃
┗━━━━━┻━━━━━┛
```

1. `1`: Default value. Outputs A4, starting at top left position.
2. `false`: Outputs at A6 format
3. `[1,4]`: Defines the position of labels on an A4 sheet. Only applies to the
   first page, subsequent pages will use the default positioning (1,2,3,4)

For more information,
see <ApiLink to="6_F" v-text='`\"Get Shipment Label\" in our API reference`' />.

### Package types and options

Set package type with `setPackageType($type)`. Retrieve it afterwards
with `getPackageType()`.

For more details on the different package types,
see <ApiLink to="6_A_1" v-text='`\"package types\" in our API reference`' />.

### Package types

#### Package

`id: 1`

This is the default package type. It must be explicitly set to allow enabling of
further shipment options. It's available for NL, EU and global shipments.

#### Mailbox package

`id: 2`

This package type is only available for NL shipments that fit into a mailbox. It
does not support additional options.

::: note

If you still make the request with additional options, bear in mind that you may
pay more than the actual shipment costs!
:::

#### Letter

`id: 3`

This package type is available for NL, EU and global shipments. The label for
this shipment is unpaid meaning that you will need to pay the postal
office/courier to send this letter/package. Therefore, it does not support
additional options.

#### Digital stamp

`id: 4`

This package type is only available for NL shipments and does not support any
additional options. Its price is calculated using the package weight, which is
set using `setPhysicalProperties()`.

::: note
This type of shipment will be billed the moment it is printed. Read
more in <ApiLink to="6_A_1" v-text='`\"package types\" in our API reference`'/>.
:::

### Package options

These options are only available for <DataType type="package-type" id="1" />.

Available options:

- `only_recipient`: Deliver the package only at address of the intended
  recipient. This option is required for Morning and Evening delivery types.
  - Set: `setOnlyRecipient(true)`
  - Get: `isOnlyRecipient()`
- `signature`: Recipient must sign for the package. This option is required for
  Pickup delivery type.
  - Set: `setSignature(true)`
  - Get: `isSignature()`
- `return`: Return the package to the sender when the recipient is not home.
  - Set: `setReturn(true)`
  - Get: `isReturn()`
- `large_format`: This option must be specified if the dimensions of the package
  are between 100 x 70 x 50 and 175 x 78 x 58 cm. If the scanned dimensions from
  the carrier indicate that this package is large format, and it has not been
  specified then it will be added to the shipment in the billing process. This
  option is also available for EU shipments.
  - Set: `setLargeFormat(true)`
  - Get: `isLargeFormat()`
- `age_check`: The Customer/Consumer must sign for the package and only receive
  it when he is at least 18 years.
  - Set: `setAgeCheck(true)`
  - Get: `hasAgeCheck()`
- `insurance`: This option allows a shipment to be insured up to certain amount.
  NL shipments can be insured for € 5000,–. EU shipments must be insured for
  € 500,–. Global shipments must be insured for € 200,–. The following
  shipment options are mandatory when insuring an NL shipment: `only_recipient`
  and `signature`.
  - Set: `setInsurance(250)` (amount in EUR)
  - Get: `getInsurance()`

#### Example

<DataType type="package-type" name="package" /> with all shipment options:

```php
(new PostNLConsignment())
    ->setPackageType(1)
    // Other options...
    ->setOnlyRecipient(true)
    ->setSignature(true)
    ->setReturn(true)
    ->setLargeFormat(true)
    ->setAgeCheck(true)
    ->setInsurance(250);
```

<DataType type="package-type" name="digital_stamp" />, with mandatory weight:

```php
(new PostNLConsignment())
    ->setPackageType(4)
    // weight in grams (required)
    ->setPhysicalProperties(['weight' => 300]);
```

For more information,
see <ApiLink to="6_A_3" v-text='`\"options\" in our API reference`' />.

### Find consignments

After creating consignments, it is often necessary to pick up a specific
consignment:

```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::find(432345);
```

Instead of `find()` you can also use `findMany()`, `findByReferenceIdentifier()`
or `findManyByReferenceIdentifier()`.

For `reference identifier` you can use a `*` to search smarter:

```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::findByReferenceIdentifier('order-14*');
```

### Query consignments

You can search and filter consignments by certain values:

```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::query(
    'api_key_from_backoffice',
    [
        'q'                    => 'Niels',
        'reference_identifier' => 'order-1234',
        'status'               => 2,
        'from'                 => '2020-01-01 00:00:00',
        'to'                   => '2020-02-01 00:00:00',
        'page'                 => 1,
        'size'                 => 200,
        'order'                => 'DESC',
        'package_type'         => 1,
        'region'               => 'NL;EU',
        'dropoff_today'        => 1,
    ]
);
```

For `q` and `reference identifier` you can use `*` (wildcards) to search
smarter.

::: tip

If the 2nd parameter is an object, then public properties will be used. If you
query in many ways, creating a separate class can provide a clean solution.
:::

For more information,
see <ApiLink to="6_E" v-text='`\"Get Shipment\" in our API reference`' />.

### Retrieve data from a consignment

Most attributes that have a `set<Attribute>()` method also have
a `get<Attribute>()` method to retrieve the data.
View [all methods for consignments](#postnlconsignment).

```php
$consignment = new PostNLConsignment();

echo $consignment->getFullStreet();
echo $consignment->getPerson();
echo $consignment->getPhone();
echo $consignment->getStreet();
// etc...
```

##### Get status

After `setPdfOfLabels()`, `setLinkOfLabels()` and `createConcepts()` you can get
the status.

```php
$status = $consignment->getStatus();
```

##### Get barcode

The barcode is available after `setPdfOfLabels()` and `setLinkOfLabels()`

```php
$barcode = $consignment->getBarcode();
```

##### Get Track & Trace URL

The Track & Trace URL is available after `downloadPdfOfLabels()`
and `getLinkOfLabels()`

```php
$consignment = (new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment());
echo $consignment->getBarcodeURL('3SMYPA123456789', '2231JE', 'NL'); // Barcode , Postal code, Country
```

### Create and download label(s)

Create and directly download PDF with `setPdfOfLabels($position)`
where `$positions` is the [label position](#label-format-and-position)
value.

```php
$consignments
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    // Opens pdf "inline" by default, pass false as argument to download file instead
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels(false);
```

Create and echo download link to PDF with `setLinkOfLabels($position)`
where `$positions` is the [label position](#label-format-and-position)
value. If you want more than 25 labels in one response, `setLinkOfLabels` will
automatically use a different endpoint. At that point, it is likely that the PDF
is not ready yet. You should check periodically if the PDF is ready for
download.

```php
echo $consignments
    ->setLinkOfLabels($positions)
    ->getLinkOfLabels();
```

If you want to download a label at a later time, you can also use the following
to fill the collection:

```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::findByReferenceIdentifier('order-146', 'api_key_from_backoffice');
$consignments
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels();
```

Instead of `findByReferenceIdentifier()` you can also
use `findManyByReferenceIdentifier()`, `find()` or `findMany()`.

For more information,
see <ApiLink to="6_F" v-text='`\"Get Shipment Label\" in our API reference`' />.

### Create and save orders

Start by creating an `OrderCollection` and setting your API key:

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Collection\Fulfilment\OrderCollection;

$orderCollection = (new OrderCollection())
    ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice');
```

Define the billing and shipping addresses of the order with the `Recipient`
class.

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Recipient;

$address = (new Recipient())
    ->setCompany('MyParcel')
    ->setPerson('Ms. Parcel')
    ->setEmail('ms@myparcel.nl')
    ->setPhone('0233030315')
    // Note: This field includes house number and number suffix.
    ->setStreet('Antareslaan 31')
    ->setPostalCode('2132JE')
    ->setCity('Hoofddorp')
    ->setCc('NL');
```

Create an `Order`:

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Fulfilment\Order;

$order = (new Order())
    // The unique identifier of the order in your webshop.
    ->setExternalIdentifier('set_external_identifier')
    // Shipping address of the customer.
    ->setRecipient($shippingAddress)
    // Invoice/billing address of the customer.
    ->setInvoiceAddress($billingAddress)
    // The delivery options. Must be an instance of AbstractDeliveryOptionsAdapter.
    ->setDeliveryOptions($deliveryOptions)
    // The date when the order was placed. Can be a DateTime object or a string in Y-M-d H:i:s format.
    ->setOrderDate(new DateTime());
```

To create order lines, you'll probably want to loop over the order lines from
the order in your webshop. Every Order should contain one or more order lines.

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Fulfilment\OrderLine;

$orderLine = (new OrderLine())
    // Full price in cents, regardless of quantity, excluding VAT.
    ->setPrice(1972)
    // Full price in cents, regardless of quantity, including VAT.
    ->setPriceAfterVat(2495)
    // VAT in cents.
    ->setVat(523)
    // Amount of Products in this OrderLine.
    ->setQuantity(3)
    // Arbitrary key/value instructions. Currently unused.
    ->setInstructions([
        'wrapping' => 'the blue one with kittens on it'
    ]);
```

An order line stores its product data in `Product`. You can set product data in
two different ways:

By getting the `Product` and setting properties on there. When an `OrderLine` is
created an empty `Product` is always created:

```php
$orderLine->getProduct()
     // Product name.
    ->setName('Long Sleeved Button Up Shirt')
    // Additional product description.
    ->setDescription('White and blue')
    // Stock Keeping Unit of the product.
    ->setSku('MYPA-0012345')
    // The unique identifier of the product in your webshop software.
    ->setExternalIdentifier('#0001394')
    // Weight in grams
    ->setWeight(0)
    // Height in millimeters
    ->setHeight(0)
    // Length in millimeters
    ->setLength(0)
    // Width in millimeters
    ->setWidth(0);
```

Or by creating a `Product` separately and using `OrderLine::setProduct()`.

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Fulfilment\Product;

$product = new Product();
// You can use the same setters from the example above.

$orderLine->setProduct($product);
```

Finally, add the created OrderLine to the order:

```php
$order->getOrderLines()->push($orderLine);
```

And add the order to the OrderCollection

```php
$orderCollection->push($order);
```

When the order is complete, save it to our API by using the `save` method.

```php
$savedOrderCollection = $orderCollection->save();
```

###### Full example

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Collection\Fulfilment\OrderCollection;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Fulfilment\Order;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Fulfilment\OrderLine;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Recipient;

$orderCollection = (new OrderCollection())
    ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice');

$customerAddress = (new Recipient())
    ->setCompany('MyParcel')
    ->setPerson('Ms. Parcel')
    ->setEmail('ms@myparcel.nl')
    ->setPhone('0233030315')
    ->setStreet('Antareslaan 31')
    ->setPostalCode('2132JE')
    ->setCity('Hoofddorp')
    ->setCc('NL');

$order = (new Order())
    ->setExternalIdentifier('set_external_identifier')
    ->setFulfilmentPartnerIdentifier('set_fulfilment_partner_identifier')
    ->setRecipient($customerAddress)
    ->setInvoiceAddress($customerAddress)
    ->setDeliveryOptions($deliveryOptions)
    ->setOrderDate(new DateTime());

foreach ($orderLines as $orderLineData) {
    $orderLine = (new OrderLine())
        ->setPrice(1972)
        ->setPriceAfterVat(2495)
        ->setVat(523)
        ->setQuantity(3)
        ->setInstructions([
            'wrapping' => 'the blue one with kittens on it'
        ]);

    $orderLine->getProduct()
        ->setWeight(10)
        ->setHeight(4)
        ->setLength(12)
        ->setWidth(100);

    $order->getOrderLines()->push($orderLine);
}

$orderCollection->push($order);

$savedOrderCollection = $orderCollection->save();
```

### Adding order notes to an order

It is possible to add notes to an order. These notes are visible in the backoffice. A note can be either a customer note or a webshop note. A webshop note can be created in the admin panel of an e-commerce platform.

To add a note to an order, simply create an `OrderNote` and add it to an `OrderNoteCollection`. Then, save the collection to our API.

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Fulfilment\OrderNote;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Collection\Fulfilment\OrderNoteCollection;

$orderNoteCollection = new OrderNoteCollection();
$orderNote           = new OrderNote([
    'orderUuid' => 'uuid_of_order', // You need the uuid generated by our API.
    'note'      => 'This is a note',
    'author'    => 'webshop', // This can be either 'webshop' or 'customer'.
])

$orderNoteCollection->push($orderNote);

// This will send the order note to our API. Thanks to the uuid, the note will
// be placed in the correct order.
$savedOrderNoteCollection = $orderNoteCollection->save();
```

::: note
Note: The uuid of an order can be found in the response of the `save` method of the `OrderCollection`. Therefore, you need to save the order first before you can add notes to it.
:::

### Setting up webhooks

You can use our webhooks to keep track of changes in shipments, labels and your
shop settings in the most efficient way.

Do note that most of our webhooks do not send a lot of data in the payload. They
are more like a notification with a few properties to allow you to decide to
proceed to send another request or not. This is for increased security and to
reduce unnecessary bandwidth usage.

### Prerequisites

- Your website must use HTTPS.

### Registering a webhook

Register a webhook by instantiating the `WebhookWebService` you want, passing
your API key and executing `subscribe` with the URL you want to receive the
payloads. You can only have one subscription to each webhook.

```php
$service = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Services\Web\Webhook\ShipmentStatusChangeWebhookWebService();

$webhookId = $service
    ->setApiKey('base64-encoded-api-key')
    ->subscribe('https://mywebsite.com/path/to/webhook');

// Save $webhookId somewhere safe.
```

::: note
`ShipmentStatusChangeWebhookWebService` can be any of the services described
in [Available Webhooks](#available-webhooks).
:::

### Deleting a webhook

To delete a webhook, you need to pass your API key and the numeric id you've
received when registering the webhook.

```php
$service = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Services\Web\Webhook\ShipmentStatusChangeWebhookWebService();

$service
    ->setApiKey('base64-encoded-api-key')
    ->unsubscribe($webhookId);
```

::: tip
In case you lost the ID, you can do an authenticated call
to `https://api.myparcel.nl/webhook_subscriptions` to retrieve it. You can also
subscribe to the same endpoint again, which will remove the old subscription.
:::

### Available webhooks

#### ShipmentStatusChange

Triggered when any shipment's status changes. This is the recommended way to
keep track of shipment statuses.

  "data": {
    "hooks": [
      {
        "shop_id": 12345,
        "attributes": ["general_settings", "modified"],
        "event": "shop_updated"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### ShopCarrierConfigurationUpdated

`\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Services\Web\Webhook\ShopCarrierConfigurationUpdatedWebhookWebService`

Triggered when the carrier configuration in a shop is updated, for example when
a different drop-off point is selected.

##### Response

Example: After changing the default drop-off time for PostNL from `16:00`
to `16:30`.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "hooks": [
      {
        "shop_id": 58585,
        "event": "shop_carrier_configuration_updated"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### MyParcelCustomsItem

This object is embedded in the PostNLConsignment object for global shipments and
is mandatory for non-EU shipments.

`MyParcelNL/Sdk/src/Model/MyParcelCustomsItem`

```php
  ->setAmount(3) // Amount of items in the package

  // ISIC/IDEP code (https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/deelnemers-enquetes/deelnemers-enquetes/bedrijven/onderzoek/lopend/internationale-handel-in-goederen/idep-codelijsten)
  ->setClassification(0111) // Example: 0111 = "Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds"
  ->setCountry('NL') // Country of origin
  ->setDescription('Cereal grains')
  ->setItemValue(40000) // Price of item in cents
  ->setWeight() // The total weight for these items in whole grams. Between 0 and 20000 grams.

  ->getAmount()
  ->getClassification()
  ->getCountry()
  ->getDescription()
  ->getItemValue()
  ->getWeight()

  ->isFullyFilledItem()
```

## Helpers

### MyParcelCollection

Stores all consignments to communicate with the MyParcel API. MyParcelCollection
also contains almost [all methods](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/collections)
from Laravel Collections. If you use Laravel it also
extends `\Illuminate\Support\Collection`.

`MyParcelNL/Sdk/src/Helper/MyParcelCollection.php`

```php
    // Add consignment to collection
    ->addConsignment()
    // Generate the return consignments based on already added consignments
    ->generateReturnConsignments()

    // Get consignments from the collection
    ->getConsignments()
    ->getConsignmentByApiId()
    ->getConsignmentsByReferenceIdentifier()

    // Clear the collection
    ->clearConsignmentsCollection()

    // Create or delete concept shipments in the MyParcel Backoffice
    ->createConcepts()
    ->deleteConcepts()

    ->getOneConsignment()
    ->getRequestBody()

    // Send return label to customer. The customer can pay and download the label
    ->sendReturnLabelMails()
    // Set id and run this function to update all the information about this shipment
    ->setLatestData()

    ->setLinkOfLabels()
    ->getLinkOfLabels()

    // Refer to
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels()

    // To give us insight into which CMS you're connecting from, you should send a User-Agent.
    // If you're using a known CMS it's required.
    // You must send the name of the CMS (required) followed by a version number (optional).
    ->setUserAgents(['name_of_cms', '1.0'])
    ->getUserAgent()
```

## Delivery options from the checkout with adapters

You can use `DeliveryOptionsAdapterFactory` if you
use [our Delivery Options module] in your checkout. You can use these adapters
to receive the options anywhere in your code in a consistent way. If you also
have the options in a different format, you can also make your own adapter.

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Adapter\DeliveryOptions\DeliveryOptionsFromOrderAdapter;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Factory\DeliveryOptionsAdapterFactory;

try {
	// Create new instance from known json
	$deliveryOptions = DeliveryOptionsAdapterFactory::create(json_decode($dataFromCheckout));
} catch (BadMethodCallException $e) {
	// Create new instance from your own data
	$deliveryOptions = new DeliveryOptionsFromOrderAdapter(null, (array) $meta);
}
```

Adapters are independent of consignments. It is therefore your responsibility to
transform an adapter into a consignment.

## Exceptions

MyParcel uses several types of Exceptions to make the errors clear. It is your
responsibility to provide the correct status in a response. These are the
Exceptions that we currently use.

### InvalidConsignmentException

Exception to be returned when an address is incorrect or not usable.

Class: `MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Exception\InvalidConsignmentException`

HTTP status: <Http code="412" />

### ApiException

Exception to be returned when a call to MyParcel services has failed.

Class: `MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Exception\ApiException`

HTTP status: <Http code="502" />

### MissingFieldException

Exception thrown when there is an attempt to dynamically access a field that
does not exist.

Class: `MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Exception\MissingFieldException`

HTTP status: <Http code="500" />

### InvalidArgumentException

Exception thrown if an argument is not the expected name.

Class: `\InvalidArgumentException`

HTTP status: <Http code="500" />

### BadMethodCallException

Exception thrown if a callback refers to an undefined method or if some
arguments are missing.

Class: `\BadMethodCallException:`

HTTP status: <Http code="500" />

## Tips

This SDK is not only useful for communicating with MyParcel, but also contains
code that you can take advantage of yourself.

### Collections

If you use arrays a lot, Collections are usually better to work with.

- `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Support\Collection()` [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/collections)

### Other helpers

- `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Support\Arr` [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/helpers#arrays)
- `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Support\Str` [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/helpers#method-camel-case)
- `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Helper\SplitStreet::splitStreet('Plein 1940-45 3b'))`
