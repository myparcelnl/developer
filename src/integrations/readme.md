## Plug-ins

Plug-ins integrate with your CMS or webshop directly and provide the best
integration with MyParcel. Most of them require little to no technical knowledge
to install and configure.

## SDKs (Software Development Kits)

An SDK can be used to quickly integrate with our API and skip a lot of the work
that comes with manually developing an API integration.

## API integrations

These integrations can be installed and configured in our Backoffice and
add the ability to import shipments from your platform(s) into ours.

<Integrations type="api" />

## Utilities

The following items are utilities you can use together with other
integrations. The Chrome Extension provides a way to quickly create shipments
from any website and can be useful regardless of whether you use any other
integrations. Our Delivery Options module is already integrated in many of our
plug-ins.
